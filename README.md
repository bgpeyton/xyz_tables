A script for converting simple .xyz coordinate files to simple LaTeX tables.

To run,
```python
python xyz2tbl.py mol.xyz
```

.xyz file must contain name of molecule on first line, as in `h2o.xyz` included.

`out.txt` will be appended, not overwritten, so feel free to make all of your tables at once!
